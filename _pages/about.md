I'm Sean! I'm an aspiring mechanical engineer with a passion for clean, sleek designs that efficiently meet their intended purpose. I'm eager to learn and I'm not afraid to approach problems from unique perspectives. If you're not wrong, you're not learning!

I graduated from Cal Poly SLO in December 2023 with my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering (concentrating in mechatronics). Since then, I've enjoyed my time traveling and working on desk projects. Most of these involve small, 1-day 3D print designs, but I have some larger projects in process. I especially have a passion for 3D printing and electromechanical systems.

I am currently looking for a full-time engineering job. If you think the fit is right, feel free to contact me at my email!
