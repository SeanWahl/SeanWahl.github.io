      institution: SpaceX
      year: Summer 2023
      description:
        - title: Built basis of Starshieldâ€™s program-wide demise analysis (working off of a similar Starlink analysis) to ensure that the vehicles met contractual requirements to avoid harm from reentry debris
          contents:
            - Gave a full-program presentation informing of demise and urging engineers to consider demisability early in their designs
        - title: Simplified Thermal Desktop model of a space laser for integration into full-satellite model to ensure thermal constraints are met
          contents:
            - Consulted with partners (internal and external) to instruct them through use of the model
        - title: Created Thermal Desktop models for joint interfaces in a simulated test setup to validate thermal conductivity to payload
          contents: 
            - Wrote testing procedures for how to go about this validation and how to correlate to the model afterwards
        - Researched micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) requirements for Starshield missions in comparison to Starlink to help justify alteration of MMOD shield.
        - Designated thermal vacuum test procedures to qualify sticker usage constraints and analyzed testing results
