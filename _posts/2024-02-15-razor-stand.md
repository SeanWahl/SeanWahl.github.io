I bought a safety razor and while I enjoy using it, I feel like it feels mistreated when I just lay it on the counter. For fun, I wanted to make a stand to hold it.

<swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true">
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/razorhorialone.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/razorhoriused.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
</swiper-container>
<div class="caption">
    The horizontal razor stand that I made.
</div>

I didn't like this design for two reasons. It wasn't much different than just laying it on the counter and there was no spot to place used blades. So I went and made a redesign.

<swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true">
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/razorvertalone.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/razorvertused.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
</swiper-container>
<div class="caption">
    The updated vertical razor stand.
</div>

I liked this design much better as it felt more unique and also had two purposes. In the future, I should add some more protection from the disposed razors, but for now, I enjoy how this looks in my bathroom. I can store up to 20 disposed blades before I have to properly dispose of them.
