I taped my power strip to the side of my desk but the tape is not strong enough to hold the strip for a significant amount of time. Instead of buying stronger tape, I wanted to make a clip to help support the power strip.

The clip has been working for months now and I am happy with it. If I really wanted to, I could redesign the clip for improved stiffness but for my purposes I don't think this is necessary. No real mechanical sizing was done on this but I did round out the corners to avoid stress concentrations right at the bends. The main goal was for this to not look terrible being attached to the side of my desk.
