I bought the wrong kind of air freshener to be used with a holder I already had. Instead of buying the correct holder or returning the air freshener, I wanted to make a small threaded compartment to hold the air freshener.

<div class="caption">
    The design has a top and bottom piece that thread together to trap the scent pad while allowing air to pass through. This can then be fixed to the air vent.
</div>

When I run out of the 3 air fresheners I bought, I might just start adding essential oils to the scent pads to keep reusing these. In the future I may change the attachment method to mount directly on the vent's slats, but for now this is fine with me.
