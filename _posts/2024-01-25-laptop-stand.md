I switched over to using a laptop docking station with two monitors, so I needed a convenient place to store the laptop while it was plugged into the docking station. I also wanted to put my laptop by its side, so I set out to design a vertical laptop stand with two slots for this purpose.

  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/standalone.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/standuse1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/standuse2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
</swiper-container>
<div class="caption">
    Here's a picture of the laptop stand alone and two pictures of it in use.

For this project I chose to prioritize looks and function over mechanically sizing it for success. I chose large thicknesses and a sturdy base to make sure that it would be able to sustain the laptop and iPad without the sides breaking. This is something that is always on my desk so I definitely did not want it to be an eyesore, which is also why I gave it a decorative pattern.
