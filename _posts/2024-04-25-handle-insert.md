My Dad bought a tap handle with an empty spot for a logo to be placed. To take up the space, I designed a small puck that can be taped inside.

<swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true">
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/handleface.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/handleangle.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/handleused.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
</swiper-container>
<div class="caption">
    Two pictures of the insert's design followed by the insert installed on the handle.
</div>

Note: This is not my logo I just had the SVG file onhand.

In the future, I could make many small pucks with the different keg types he buys for labeling the handle properly. I could even do some sort of resin inlay to improve the contrast between the logo and background. I'd also like to make the removal tab less noticeable or design an alternative removal method.
